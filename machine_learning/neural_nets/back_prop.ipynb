    "Back Propagation is essentially a \\$2 way of saying \"make an incremental change to your weights and biases, relative to our error.\" Like Gradient Descent, the main goal is doing a bunch of Chain Rule magicâ„¢ to find all of our partial derivatives. Then we calculate our error by taking a simple (actual - expected) and marching backwards through the Net using some small learning rate, and adjustments to each of the matricies."
